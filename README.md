# Comment Generator
### Created by Jerry Spice 
## What is this?
The comment generator takes in a java file and writes sample comment blocks for it. I hate writing comments for my college classes so I wrote some code to do all the boring stuff for me.
For example, the test classes we need to write all need comments to explain what they're testing. I could go in and manually create all the comment blocks and then fill in all the info.
But they all say the same thing anyway. Tests this method through this way, blah blah blah. 
So yeah. That's all this is. 
It only works on Java files at the moment and it's not very thorough so if you would like to use it, feel free.
